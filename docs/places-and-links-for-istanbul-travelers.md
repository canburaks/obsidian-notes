## Food Places
A bunch of places that I suggest to people who are not native to Istanbul. I went to those places at least once and liked them. Those are personal suggestions and doesn't include any affiliation.


### Lades (Breakfast & Lunch)
Menemen is basically a local food prepared with eggs scrambled with tomatoes and green pepper. It looks like simple food. However, if you try it at Lades Restaurant, you'll be amazed.  It has been rated the __Best Menemen Maker__ by newspapers for years.
It is as as delicious as a meal made with these ingredients can be. They are chosen always as the best menemen maker in the country.

## Kızılkayalar (Fast Food)
You'll see many local fast-food company near Taksim square. Despite all of them looks similar, Kizilkayalar is a distinguished one. The place is  open 24/7.  My favorite food is meat doner, however the place is popular for  its wet hamburger.

### Fıccın (Lunch & Dinner)
FICCIN Beyoğlu is one of the legendary restaurants of Kallavi street. Run by two  sisters, this restaurant is one of the favorite restaurants of those working in the Beyoğlu area.
It can be preferred for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a wide menu including rich tastes of Circassian cuisine.

### Nizam Pide (Lunch & Dinner)
Nizam is a restaurant that serves local Turkish and Anatolian cuisine.
Their milk desserts are just as delicious as their kebabs. I personally like their various pide (pittahs) options and chicken grill.
You should also try a local dessert named Sütlaç (Rice pudding).  Nizam is one of the best sütlaç makers in the region.

### Midpoint (Dinner)
Country-wise upper-segment franchise. It is rare to go and leave there unhappy because of food you ordered. It is located on the Istiklal Street and has a beautiful view.

### Babylon Bomonti (Concert Hall & Night)
Babylon is a live music venue with up to 500 - 1000 people. It has a bunch of place near the concert hall. Nice and isolated place. Actually I worked in there ten years ago, I can clearly say that it is a globally knoıwn and respected music venue.

### App for ordering food: Yemek Sepeti
You can also order food with a mobie app namely Yemek Sepeti. Most of food places are registered on the app. You can order almost anything from the app. I'm not sure it requires a local phone number or not but can be try.
